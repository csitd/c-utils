fetch.c fetches some large files decently, but
  fails strangely on the index.html of google,
  facebook etc, unless the page is first sent to
  a private site. This indicates there is some
  error in the certificate handling.

  fetch.c is not handling arguments with huge
  shell expansions of file paths, ie; wc /etc/*
  Perhaps a call to stat() to make sure the 
  files are of a readable type would fix this.

mv.c needs to be tightened up so that it is not
  attempting removal of empty files, and files 
  that may already have been removed.

grep.c -o options needs to be fixed or removed,
  only certain regex matches are performing
  correctly in -o mode.

tar.c has bugs with large files over 8 GB
  this needs further testing on a machine
  with fast disk io ( or any dedicated
  machine with a half decent hard drive).
