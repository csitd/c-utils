These utilities are still in the testing phase, and not
ready for public use.  



Ctools is a set of micro sized utilties which are tailored
toward being simple to read and understand. In this manner it
can track ideas and potential implementations without getting 
bogged down with the details of complex command line options, 
and other potentially semi-useless stuff.  


The code is designed to be portable to a certain extent. Testing
is done on linux and freebsd, testing against Busybox, GNU tools
and Freebsd's core utilities.

Some tools that only work on linux as of this time:
ifconfig.c
df.c
memused.c
dmesg.c

At some point when these can be rewritten to work on freebsd I
may have to divide the repository into two sections:

linux/ 

freebsd/ 






All of the work here is under constant revision and testing and 
has not had a formal release.

If you want to use these tools please consider contributing to 
the code base by; doing security testing/auditing, expanding
the scripted control "tests" area or simply writing new tools
and/or sharing your ideas.
